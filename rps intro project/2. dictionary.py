# dictionaries
# Dictionaries in python are used to store data values in key value pairs

# Dictionary is defined as "name of dictionary" = {"key": "value", "key2": "value2"}, 
# Value of a key can be variable too, for that you dont need to surround it with "", ex = {"key": choices}

my_height = "180cm" # variable 
data = {"name": "my name", "height": my_height} 

print(data) # Printing dictionary called data on console
