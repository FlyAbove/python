# Sets is a collection of data which is unordered, unchangeable and unindexed
# Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items

# Some valid examples of sets are written down below

set1 = {"Home", "Thomas"}
set2 = {"Home", "Shelby", "Alpha"}

# Sets in maths can be intersected
# We use & to show intersection âˆ© symbol in maths

intersection = set1 & set2 
print(intersection)

# We can take a union of sets like we take one in maths
# We use | symbol to show union U symbol in maths

union = set1 | set2 
print(union)

# We can take difference of two sets line we take on in maths

difference = set1 - set2
print(difference)
